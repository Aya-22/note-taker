## The main focus of this project is to use npm to connect the html pages to the server using the activities we learned this week.

The main file that I worked on was server.js. The first step taken was to install the npm package for express and path. Once the packages were installed I worked on framework for a server, as we learned in class earlier in the week. Reviewing the past activities was really helpful with this homework assignment. I worked on the get, post, and delete functions for the server. I am still working on the delete function of the code.

The following image shows the completed web application after using JavaScript:
